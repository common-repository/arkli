Arkli is a communications platform that allows you to schedule multiple posts to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn (including groups) and (soon) Google+. It automatically tags links with Google Analytics code, and provides amazing statistics, all from Wordpress. 

== Description ==

After connecting your social media accounts you can schedule multiple posts to those networks.  When the time comes, Arkli publishes the posts to the right channel at the right time.

Once the posts have been published, Arkli provides detailed stats on each post, including the reach of each social media post, the number of clicks and more. If you link your Google Analytics account we'll also show you how many people converted from your campaign, and how much they spent, so you can measure your social media activity.

Arkli is free for individuals use.  Companies or web applications can license Arkli.  See http://www.arkli.com/pages/pricing for details.

== Installation ==

1. Upload arkli folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!  Arkli Social Anywhere will show up at the bottom when you create a new blog post or page.
